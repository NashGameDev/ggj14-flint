My entry for the global game jam 2014.

The theme this year was:  "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."

My approach was to create a 3 player splitscreen game.

"Flint" is an "endless runner" in which the players each try to run through their target color.

Each Player uses three keys to move into one of three lanes.

Player 1 uses "A", "B", and "C"
Player 2 uses "B", "N", and "M"
Player 3 uses "Left Arrow", "Up Arrow", and "Right Arrow"

The game is maybe 20-30% complete, but I'm submitting what I have so far.

GGJ14 was awesome and I had a complete blast!  Congrats to everyone on their games!
